### Artz-Self-Bot
A powerful selfbot made with hydrabolt's library (discord.js v11.1)
<> by â™¥ from TheOnlyArtz, This bot is very basic including only 8 commands
but you will see way more soon,

### How Do I Use It?
Well, when it comes to **Self Bot** that means you need to supply
Your own account's token in, so How are we going to do that?
Simply open Discord and press `f12` in the browser on discordapp.com then go to 'Application' and
At the buttom you will see Token category and please **Dont sure this token with someone**
Sharing you token will be pure pain since you cannot regenerate it...
Now after you got the secret token Go ahead and open `private.json.example`
take down the `.example` from the name and inside the file put your token

```js
{
  "token" : "YourSuperSecretHere"
}
```

Inside app.js you will find the message event or look for something like
if (message.author.id !== "numbers") return;
Now these numbers are my ID but change the numbers to your ID
for example
```js
if (message.author.id !== "277518204224405505") return;
```

**`AND THATS IT , YOU ARE GOOD TO GO`**
